# Simulation_of_Zo_sqrt-ZscZoc-_calculation
MATLAB code for experimenting with a Transmission Line's Zo = SQRT(Zsc*Zoc)

Allows simulation of a 75 ohms transmission line with the following options:
   o  cal'd with actual or ideal SOL terminations
   o  SOL characterizations within a "virtual" VNA are actual or ideal.  
   o  coax terminated with actual or ideal short and open.
